# Security Guidelines & Best Practices

## üîí Security Configuration

### Environment Variables
All sensitive configuration should be stored in environment variables:

```bash
# Required environment variables
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret_here
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_encryption_key_here
```

### API Key Management
- **Never commit API keys to version control**
- Use environment variables for all API keys
- Rotate keys regularly in production environments
- Use different keys for development and production

### Database Security
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable SSL/TLS connections
- Implement proper access controls
- Regular security updates

## üõ°Ô∏è Deployment Security

### Production Checklist
- [ ] All environment variables configured
- [ ] API keys rotated and secured
- [ ] Database credentials updated
- [ ] SSL/TLS certificates installed
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] Rate limiting enabled
- [ ] Logging and monitoring active

### Network Security
- Deploy only in isolated lab environments
- Use VPN for remote access
- Implement firewall rules
- Monitor network traffic
- Regular security audits

## üîê Authentication & Authorization

### Session Management
- Use secure session cookies
- Implement session timeout
- Secure session storage
- Regular session cleanup

### Access Control
- Implement role-based access control
- Use strong authentication methods
- Regular access reviews
- Audit trail logging

## üìä Monitoring & Logging

### Security Monitoring
- Monitor failed login attempts
- Track suspicious activities
- Alert on security events
- Regular security reports

### Log Management
- Centralized logging system
- Log retention policies
- Secure log storage
- Regular log analysis

## üö® Incident Response

### Security Incident Plan
1. **Detection**: Identify security incidents
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate impact and scope
3. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
4. **Eradication**: Remove threats
5. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
6. **Lessons Learned**: Improve security measures
